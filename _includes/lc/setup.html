  <h3>Python</h3>
  <p>
    Python is a popular language for research computing, and great for 
    general-purpose programming as well. Installing all of its research packages 
    individually can be a bit difficult, so we recommend Anaconda, an all-in-one 
    installer. Please find setup instructions in the 
    <a href="https://chennesy.github.io/lc-python-intro/#installing-python-using-anaconda">lesson</a>.

    same.
